		<h1> The Nintendo 3DS </h1>
		<h5><em>By <span>Toby Brown</span></em> </h5>
		<p> <h3> The 3DS is a console released by Nintendo in 2011. Over my "many" years of living I have gained much wisdom about said console, and I have played several games.<br>
When I was a wee chap
I vividly remember my mum buying me my own Nintendo 2DS- and ever since I was hooked. Ive had the pleasure to play through several games- some good and some bad -<br> and in doing so the 3DS has become
a huge part of who I am, the games supporting me through some big changes in my life. <br> On this website, I will showcase the history of the console as well some of my favourite games so that you can give em a play as well. </p> </h3>
